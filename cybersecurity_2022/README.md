## Lesson 1 - Intro

### Requisite (because it is a logical AND between all the following) to attend this course:
1. Use the *pen-and-paper* approach to take notes during each lecture! This is the most important part of the whole course. If you don't take notes, it is likely that you won't remember what we have done. Mis-understanding will pile up in time and we won't be speaking the same language very very soon (as you won't understand what I'm saying).
2. *Study*! If you don't invest time in reading and **reason** on your notes (something like: "wait! I wrote integrity but what was the definition? let's look on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)) you can spare the effort of keeping notes in the first place. You *have to* spend your time in reasoning on your notes or you won't understand what we are doing. At the beginning it may seem you can remember the whole blablabla of each lesson, but it is going to become ultra-complex in a bit. The difference between listening and understanding determines the distance that you have to walk in this course: 
   1. listen, 
   2. draft notes, 
   3. review note with a critical mind (wikipedia, duckduckgo, google and **marco@v-research.it** are your best [friends](https://www.amazon.it/Lamicizia-latino-fronte-Tullio-Cicerone/dp/8817067008/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DVEA9A01CN98&keywords=cicerone+amicizia&qid=1646997948&sprefix=cicerone+amicizia%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-1)... Cicero too), 
   4. believe you have understood something, 
   5. test your believed understanding until you find a counter-example (how? talk to your [best friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), and 
   6. be vigilant forever after.
4. Create a [study group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group) and study together because "When students study in groups, they can motivate and encourage each other and lessen procrastination". Consider investing time (e.g., a couple of hours) after each lesson to review together the notes. Tell each other (even if it seems trivial) what we've done during the last lesson(s) and if it is all clear then:
5. *Relax*. Take your time, stay away from your notes. Let them ripe.

### What is Cybersecurity in the Context of this ITS?
1. What is something? What does it even mean to understand *what* something *is*? This is too long to be discussed here but there's a friend who is willing to tell you... well, unfortunately he's dead but he left you a [precious book](https://www.amazon.it/scoperta-scientifica-carattere-autocorrettivo-scienza/dp/8806203924/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=popper+la+logica+della+scoperta+scientifica&qid=1646999719&sprefix=popper+la+logica%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-1). We know that ideas on what a phenomenon is (or hypothesis) should be *invented* and **not** defined by observing the phenomenon. 
> "[â€¦] and I think (like you, by the way) that theory cannot be fabricated out of the results of observation, but that it can only be invented." Albert Einstein writing to Karl Popper.

So, cybersecurity cannot be understood out of the results of observation but, in this course, we are going to understand cybersecurity out of the results of observation anyway! Why? Because how could we even conceive to ask ourselves "what is cybersecurity?" if we didn't stumble upon some "observation" or some situation in which cyber-insecurity was evident?

### Ok, WAT?
For us cybersecurity is the [CIA-triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability), meaning that any system in which the CIA-triad holds is (for us) secure (enough). For simplicity, suppose a component of a system (e.g., a web-server) is talking to you (e.g., to your browser) by sending you some *messages*.

* Confidentiality holds if only the trusted peers (e.g., the web-server and your browser) can *understand* the content of the messages. Of course, it would be "more confidential" if not even the web-server and the browser would be able to understand the content of the messages but it would be pretty useless.
* Integrity holds when the trusted parties can understand if the message has been corrupted (accidentally) or altered (e.g., maliciously by an attacker).
* [Availability](https://www.wordreference.com/enit/availability) holds when we are able to understand if a service (e.g., the web-server or a web-site) is "down" or not available.

#### Did you say attacker?
An *attacker* is what is usually, mistakenly called hacker. In this course we want to learn how to protect our system from a malicious cracker, someone who mainly wants to break the CIA triad and we call him/her attacker.
An *hacker*, instead, is "a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular. The term is often misused in a pejorative context, where cracker would be the correct term". [RFC-1392](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1392).

#### How do we guarantee the CIA-triad holds in a system?
Using the so-called [Alice-and-Bob notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_protocol_notation) where Alice (A) and Bob (B) are honest and Eve (E) is the malicious attacker, if Alice wants to send "ciao bob" to Bob:
* To preserve confidentiality, Alice can agree with Bob upon using a specific transformation over each message. Let's say, they will substitute each letter in the message by a letter at some fixed number of positions (which we call `k`) down the alphabet. So, the message "ciao bob" is transformed into "dlbp cpc" if `k=1` and `A->B:dlbp cpc` will only be understood from Bob (since he's the only one who knows how to translate the message back into its meaning - and we assume, for simplicity, that Eve is not so clever to figure out we are doing this "trick").
* To preserve integrity, Alice chooses to send, along with the message "dlbp cpc" the number of zeros that you'd obtain by translating the message into a string of bits (or a bitstring) using [this tool](https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-ascii-to-binary) and the concept of [ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). `A->B: dlbp cpc 39`. 

1. How can we guarantee availability? We'll look into this in the following lessons.
2. Is integrity actually preserved? No... well, not in a cybersecurity context. Suppose that Alice publicly shares that she appends to each message the number of zeros of the conversion of the message into a bitstring, so that anyone can verify the integrity of her messages. If Eve captures the message "dlbp cpc 39" she can alter the message AND the number of zeros accordingly. So, Bob wont be able to notice that the message that Alice sent was altered by Eve. Obviously, Eve won't be able to produce a valid message but only because Alice encrypted it. So, Bob will probably think that Alice is saying nonsense but he doesn't know that the integrity of the message has been corrupted. 
3. Is confidentiality preserved? Yes. Obviously our approach can easily be broken but "ciao bob" is out plaintext (the plain message which anyone can understand) and "dlbp cpc" is the confidentiality-preserving message that can only be understood by the peers who know that `k=1` and the value of k must be kept secret (only Alice and Bob know that k=1 and Eve doesn't).

### Our Security Goal
In this course we will focus on the security of a Postgres database. Why? Because it offers us the possibility to study the security of data-at-rest (i.e., the data stored into the db), the security of data-in-transit (i.e., the data transferred when we communicate, using a client, with the db), and some security principle such as the [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). Furthermore, a database is often one of the most important assets (since it contains most if not all the data of a system), Postgres is one of the most used software when it comes to database, and it is quite easy to install & configure.

### Do you speak techy?
0. have a decent computer (we can give you one if your is "old" or "tired")
1. Install a virtual machine (e.g. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.4&architecture=amd64) - Why? Because you don't want to "try" something on your computer. You are going to make a mess (we are explorers! and sometimes wanderers) and you don't like re-installing the OS on your computer.
   1. A [Virtual Machines](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html) (VM) is a *software* virtualization of a computer. You create a new "virtual computer" inside your real computer. So you can trash the virtual computer if you mess up and your real computer won't even notice.
   2. You can take a [snapshot](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html) of a VM and you can go back to that snapshot (e.g., if you mess up). So, take a snapshot right after having installed Ubuntu and you can go back to a clean Ubuntu installation whenever you want.
2. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on the VM.
   1. `sudo apt update` updates the links from which Ubuntu will search for software
   2. `sudo apt install postgresql` will install the latest version of PostgreSQL supported by the OS (on Ubuntu 20.04 is v12)
   3. `sudo systemctl status postgresql` you can check the status of the PostgreSQL process (it should be active and running)
   4. `sudo systemctl stop postgresql` you stop the PostgreSQL process (guess what happens substituting start or restart to stop)

## Lesson 2 - A Small Step for a Man
Cybersecurity deals with guaranteeing or breaking the CIA-triad. [Blue teams](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Red_Team_Blue_Team_Approach)
try to build secure systems where the CIA-triad holds, while other security
experts try to hack the system. But the blue team is protecting from what
the hackers have found to be insecure. Obviously, if you are protecting
yourself from something, you first have to know what that *something* is.
Well, this isn't actually true and the whole scientific approach is
doing the opposite by *predicting* future events that have never be seen before.
But, again, we are explorer and, as explorers, we are braver than "methodological" :)

Now, let's look closer to what cybersecurity is. For example, suppose you (Alice)
write a secret diary with a friend of your (Bob). This diary could be one of those diaries
with a cute, small, heart-shaped lock, or a cold software program that asks for a 
key as a password to be unlocked. But let's use the physical diary. 
The [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) is simple, you wrote your own [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) with your friend:
1. Alice writes secret things in the secret diary
2. Alice closes the secret diary with the small, cute lock
3. Alice gives her sister (which we could call *Honest? Network*) then locks the diary and sends her to Bob
4. Bob gets mad because Alice didn't give her sister the key to unlock the diary

Now, Alice doesn't trust her sister but she's too lazy to walk to Bob and finally
5. Alice gives her sister the key
6. Her sister is a malicious attacker and opens the diary breaking the confidentiality of the writings
7. Her sister gives the diary AND the key to Bob
8. Swap Alice with Bob and Bob with Alice and loop 1-3.

In Alice-and-Bob notation is shorter: `A -> B: secret.diary` And that `->` means that `secret.diary` passed through a communication medium (e.g. the Internet) and the `.` simply means we are concatenating `secre` with `diary`.

This story teaches us quite a few things:
- Alice, Bob, and Her sister are all happy. The sister because is evil and is reading the whole "secret" diary, Alice and Bob because they **don't know** the secrecy or the *confidentiality* is not guaranteed by their protocol. 
- Confidentiality is a property that you want to guarantee but it doesn't tell you how to guarantee it.
- Things like locks seems to be useful but it is not straightforward (mostly for the lazy ones) to use them.

So, the first rule of cybersecurity is: get to know the system you want to
secure. If Alice or Bob did spend a bit of time looking at their protocol, they would have figure out the hack by themselves.
Try to "hack" your system or, better, have a critical mind when you look at
anything, you may find that it is not as stupid, not as trivial and boring as
you first assumed. You may find an entire universe in
[something](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cgrglx/whats_a_question_so_stupid_it_gets_more_complex/)
you didn't consider worth of your time. Like, we all assume God (or the concept
of God, or Gods, or Oracles, etc) as omnipotent but we hardly figure out that
as human being we cannot understand the concept of omnipotent. We think we know
what we are saying, it's trivial... it just means "he can anything, anytime,
anywhere etc"... he can even build a rock that he himself cannot lift...
wait... but if he canNOT lift it, is he omnipotent? 

### PSQL, Unix Socket and IP Address
So, to create a secure system, we must first explore the system. And our system is PostgreSQL (or postgres for brevity).

- What is PostgreSQL? A [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL).
- But, with our cybersecurity mindset, is just like any other system. It is software that is run as a *server*/service and accepts connections from a client.

`psql` (a software) is a *client* that allows us to connect to the PostgreSQL server that we installed in the 1st lesson.
Open a terminal in your ubuntu VM and let's play with it.
- `psql --help` shows you some interesting info, like `-U`
- `psql -U postgres` connects to the postgres server with the user `postgres` but asks for a password... what is the password?

By default, during the installation process postgres configure a user `postgres` and creates a database `postgres`.
The user `postgres` isn't just a user inside the postgres server (or client), it is also a new user of your system. So, there are two users postgres, one in Ubuntu and one in PosgreSQL.
1. `sudo su postgres` asks the superuser (with the imperative `su`peruser `do`), who is the "administrator" of your Ubuntu, that you want to become `postgres` and it opens a terminal as postgres (try run `whoami`). `sudo` gives you a challenge and asks for your password (not the one of postgres) because it trusts you and assumes that whoever knows your password is you. 

So, we don't need to know the password of the `postgres` user.
2. type `exit` and go back to your user 
3. `sudo -u postgres psql` asks `sudo` to run `psql` as the `-u`ser `postgres`. And we are connected to postgres.

### Wait... Connected? How?
Postgres supports two types of connections from our psql client: via [unix socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) or via the network specifying an [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address). For us, unix sockets just allow a connection "internal" to the pc, meaning that it connects the input/outpout of the two software locally to our computer. 
- `psql -U postgres` uses unix sockets
- `psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1` uses the IP `127.0.0.1` to connect via the network. 

Actually, `127.0.0.1` is a local IP address. It is a "trick" that you can use
to test a software that you'd want to use via network one day soon... but that you are
testing locally.  `127.0.0.1` is a special IP address given to your network
card by any operating system (OS, Ubuntu too). Any software sending
packets/messages to `127.0.0.1` asks the network card to process the packet as
if it were coming from the internet but sends it back to the OS without passing
through the network.

### Hacking
Any hack requires an intimate understanding of a technology so, let's get to know postgres better.
- `sudo systemctl status postgresql` shows the status of the server/service postgres. It should be active, telling you it's running but is it running ok?
- `sudo less /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log` shows you the log of postgres, so you can check if everything is ok. (I'm using v12, you may be using a different version).
- `ls /etc/postgresql/12/main/` shows you the content of the dir that contains all the configuration files of postgres
- `less /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf` shows you the different access type. It's well documented, just read the comments. 
- `sudo nano /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf` and edit the file, modifying `peer` into `trust` for the local access using unix socket
- `psql -U postgres` won't ask you any password now, because it trusts that you are connecting securely... or it doesn't actually care about security.
- `psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1` still asks you the password because you are trusted only if you connect via unix sockets

For more fun, please have a look at the [PostgresSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) (I link you a random page, but you can click your way to the table of content).

### Authentication: "I'm not the A of the CIA-triad"
We used two important terms in this lesson: *trust* and *authentication*.
Trust is a basic notion in security. It is always there when you talk about security because you have to trust someone or something.
If I tell you I'm Marco you can trust me, you can ask my mom and trust her, you can check my ID and trust our nation, you can test my DNA and that of my parents and trust a random lab, etc.
Cybersecurity tries to reduce this trust to the minimum.
[Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) "is the process
of verifying the identity" while *identification* (which is important too) is
"the act of indicating a person's identity". A password is usually used to
*identify* and an authentication process checks the password that it takes as
input against the result of some process (e.g. by looking at a table in the
database - and this is a hint for the following questions).

Take home message: security properties are nice and we now know some of them (CIA, authentication, identification, trust) but the technology that we use to guarantee a security property often comes with extra requirements. For example, an authentication process implicitly asks you to save your password in a secure place (security of data at rest and, again, asks security for security), to share a password in a confidential way (data in transit), or to create a complex password (why?).

### Do try this at home!
- What is the authentication process of PostgreSQL? How does it authenticate the user `postgres` when we use `peer` (for example)?
- Authentication is a sub-property of integrity. Can you figure out why?

Her sister cries and cries... She hurries in her father's room, tells him she
read the secret diary and that Alice wrote her sister is ugly (tanto va la
gatta al lardo...). So Alice hears that her sister read her secret diary and
she gets mad! Not because she cares about the "citation" but because she felt
stupid, she messed up with the only secure thing she had and, most importantly,
she knows she's too lazy to give herself the key to Bob. Her father has an
idea.
1. Alice puts the secret diary in a box and closes the box with a lock
2. Her sister takes the box but she cannot open it because Alice kept the key, so she gives it to Bob
3. Bob add another lock to the box and gives it to the "Her sister" (ndr I should have give her a name, poor thing)
2. Her sister takes the box but she cannot open because Bob kept the key, so she gives it to Alice
3. Alice removes her lock with her key. She can't open the box because of Bob's key and she gives it to her sister
4. Her sister again cannot unlock Bob's key and gives the box to Bob
5. Bob removes the last lock and gets the secret diary
6. The lived securely ever after

## Lesson 3 - Authentication in Depth
Authentication is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity since it allows us to 
"mechanize" the process of giving our identity to a system so that the system
can provide us with the content we want. What a system authenticates is *not*
the identity of a person but the credentials given by a client (i.e., of a software
that implements a client, for example, the software client `psql`). The reason
why we don't authenticate the person behind the client but the client itself
is simple: we must assume that the person behind the client is willingly and consciously
providing us the identification credentials, e.g. username and password. In other words,
we *trust* the person, not the client. Therefore, we want to authenticate the client.

1. Execute the command `whoami` (in a BASH shell) it outputs the name of
the user you are operating on your Linux system (e.g. my user is named `x`).
2. If you execute `psql -U postgres` (assuming that the config file `pg_hba.conf` 
has the local access set to `trust`, i.e., `psql` doesn't run an authentication process and then it doesn't asks for a password)
you asks your user (`x`) to run `psql` which, in turn, asks
to log-in to the postgres DBMS as the user `postgres`.
3. Once we are connected to the DBMS, we can execute `ALTER ROLE postgres WITH PASSWORD 'ciao';` (remember the semicolon)
to change the password of the user postgres in the DBMS to "ciao".
Note: ROLEs and USERs are considered the same concept in postgres, [no big deal](ihttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/user-manag.html)

Now we can finally ask some security questions:

1. data at rest: Is the password of the user postgres stored securely? 
2. data in transit: Is the password exchange between client (`psql`) and server (postgres DBMS) secure?
3. Is the password "ciao" a secure password?
 
We know security means CIA-triad but only questions 1. and 2. seems to make sense (w.r.t. the CIA-triad)
so, let's start from them.

### Security of Data at Rest
In the authentication process between `psql` and the DBMS, the DBMS is the
system which verifies the authenticity of the credentials (username and password)
provided by `psql`. So, the DBMS must have the pair username and password (e.g., `postgres,ciao`)
stored somewhere. Remember that the DBMS is a collection of databases (db), so:
1. `psql -U postgres`
2. `\?` to see all the commands you can provide to postgres (`/database` to search the keyword "database")
3. `\l` to list al the db (it shows a db named `postgres`)
4. `\c postgres` to connect to the db named `postgres`
5. `\d` to list the tables... but it doesn't show any credential table... because this table is, by default,
generated for any new instance of the DBMS  and only tables created by us are shown with `\d`. 
6. But with `\dS+` we can see all the tables, even those not 
created by us (`\auth` to search in the output of `\dS+` the tables which deals with authentication).
7. `SELECT * FROM pg_authid` shows the content of the table which we can refine with `SELECT rolname,rolpassword FROM pg_authid` to
get the credentials (username and password) of the postgres user.

The password is not stored as "ciao" but with a string similar to md52e2af93edc9ab3aea6bbf13b7c409000.
Passwords are not stored in cleartext in postgres. This guarantees confidentiality since
we cannot understand the password by looking at the stored string representing the password.
There are many processes (or algorithms) that we can use to transform the 
password 'ciao' into an incomprehensible text, and the one used by postgres is:
- written in the `postgres.conf` file as `password_encryption=md5` and `md5` is the algorithm used, and
- one may change the algorithm set in the `posgres.conf` file by connecting to the DBMS and executing
   - `ALTER SYSTEM SET password_encryption TO scram-sha-256` and 
   - we can check the current algorithm by running `SHOW password_encryption` (`SHOW all` shows all the parameter you can set and check).
   - or simply edit the `postgres.conf` file and restart postgres with `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`.

### Cryptographic Hash Functions
[md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) is "a cryptographically (broken but still widely used) hash function".
An [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) (or, more precisely, a cryptographic hash function) is 
- a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the "message") to a bit array of a fixed size (the hash value, or hash)
- It is a *one-way function*, that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation (i.e., from the password you can get an hash but from the hash you cannot obtain the password),
- it is *deterministic*, meaning that the same message always results in the same hash,
- it is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value,
- it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value,
- a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that a new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value (avalanche effect).

So, basically, given the md5 hash of "ciao"
(md52e2af93edc9ab3aea6bbf13b7c409000) we cannot write a program that obtains
"ciao" (unless, obviously, the program knows a-priori "ciao").  And this is what allows us to store the hash of a password in a
database and, at the same time, to guarantee the confidentiality of the
cleartext password ("ciao"). 

### Password Best Practice v1
Some hash functions, such as MD5, calculates the hash quite fast (you can calculate around 9 billion MD5 hash per second with 
a regular PC). This makes MD5 susceptible to a cybersecurity attack known as [brute-force attack](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/112.html).
The idea is simple, if we obtain the MD5 hash we can write a program that automatically
computes the hash of all possible passwords and compare each hash with the one "stolen" from the db.
Let's try all the 4 characters long password, how many are them?
We have:
- 26 letters A-Z
- 26 letters a-z
- 10 digits 0..1
- let's say 10 special characters ('$','#', etc.)

So with 4 characters we have $4^(26+26+10+10)=4^72=2*10^43$ possible passwords.
If we can compute $10^10$ MD5 hash per second it takes us up to $2*10^33$ seconds which is a very, very, very long time.
But what if people were lazy and only used, say, a-z letters? Well, if you do the math, you see that in a week we got the hash.
This is why it is important to choose a strong password where *a strong password is not 
a short password or a long password but a password which is chosen from a rich alphabet* (our 72 possible character). A brilliant video 
on passwords by Cormac Herley (Microsoft Research) is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAWyChcB_Vg).

### Brute-force and Dictionary Attack
Before trying to de-hash the MD5 hash we note that there is another type of attack named [dictionary attack](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html) where,
instead of brute-forcing all the possible password we use a "dictionary" with the most common passwords (as 0000, admin, password, postgres etc.).
So, don't choose a "supercanifragilistichespiralidoso" and not even "sup3rc4n1fragilisti" because they can be guessed quite easily 
and cracked by a dictionary attack.

To perform the brute-force attack we use [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/).
1. `sudo apt install hashcat`
2. copy the MD5 hash in a file `echo "2e2af93edc9ab3aea6bbf13b7c409000" > ciao.hash` (here remember to drop the "md5" at the beginnning of the hash)
3. `hashcat -a 3 -m 12 ./ciao.hash ?a?a?a?a` where `-a 3` is for brute-force attack, `-m 12` selects Postgres md5, `?a?a?a?a` set the length of the password (see `hashcat --help` for more information) returns the password "ciao" in a minute at most!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/160302972-d5339cf2-5bfa-48af-ac90-6a3a26df1648.png)

There are hash algorithms which are purposely slower in computing the hash to prevent the brute-force attack (such as bcrypt which should be preferred to MD5 - plus MD5 has also serious flaws and should not be used - but it is not supported by postgres and the best we can do is use `sha-scram-256`.
Obviously, it's difficult to get the hash from the database, can we obtain it from the communication between `psql` and the DBMS during the client authentication?

### Security of Data in transit
Executing `psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1` it is required to enter the password
'ciao' (if `md5` is set in the `pg_hba.conf` for this connectionType-user
pair).  The password is hashed (with md5) and sent to the DBMS. So the md5 hash
transits on the network (which is currently simply the loopback but stil our
message goes from the client to the network card and then from the network card
to the DBSM). Actually, there is a series of messages that are exchanged
between the DBMS and the `psql` client but we are not digging into this
protocol. 

### Sniffing Attack
1. Install [wireshark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireshark), a software that analyzes and shows
the network traffic with `sudo apt install wireshark`.
2. Execute `sudo wireshark` and select the loopback to start sniffing the traffic from your loopback

[Sniffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack) is the act of reading the data in transit 
in a network and if we authenticate with `psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1` (and we stop collecting network traffic)
we can see all the messages exchanged over the loopback and we can find the messages communicated 
during the authentication process. However, we cannot find the hash of "ciao" because, by 
default, postgres encrypts all the communication using SSL.

### SSL and Cryptography
Connect to the postgres DBMS and run `SHOW ssl;` to see that [SSL in postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/ssl-tcp.html) is active (`on`).
If you run `SHOW all;` and search for ssl (`/ssl`) you see that:
- the library used to implement ssl is `openssl`
- the protocol version is `TLSv1`
Unfortunately, [ssl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0) was the name of
the first version of this algorithm, afterwards its name was changed in `TLS` (currently has 3 versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3). So, while
postgres uses the SSL keyword we are using TLS.
For now, we just need to know that TLS is a "cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security".
This means that the messages are processed by TLS (which is implemented in the `pqsl` software by using the library `openssl`).
and transformed into what is called a ciphertext, i.e. a text/message where confidentiality is guaranteed. Summarizing:
1. `psql -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1` asks for a password
2. the user types "ciao" (cleartext where confidentiality is not guaranteed)
3. the keyboard transfers "ciao" via UNIX sockets to the program `psql` (as cleartext)
4. `psql` runs MD5 on it, obtaining an hash of "ciao" where confidentiality if guaranteed
5. `psql` runs TLSv1 to encrypt the hash into a ciphertext where the confidentiality of the hash (not of the cleartext) is guaranteed
So, even sniffing the traffic we cannot obtain the hash of the password.

Let's try our previous attack after setting the option `ssl_enabled=off` in the `postgresql.conf` file and restart `sudo systemctl restart postgres`.
You'll see that one of the messages contains an md5 hash. Can you get the cleartex password with `hashcat`?

### Passwords and Best Practices, for Real this Time
Please note that md5 is insecure and `scarm-sha-256` should be used instead.
Edit your `postgres.conf` and set `password_encryption = scram-sha-256`. This
hash algorithm still doesn't provide brute-force protection but it 
doesn't have the technical security flaws of md5.

## Lesson 4 - With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
Everyone knows that [power and responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility)
go together ["like the horse and carriage"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRDBvKGc1fE) but really... please, don't be stupid! 
We use tools and techniques that may "attract" you into the dark side but there are SERIOUS consequences if you start craking things here and there.
So, let's use the material of this course to hack and not to crack which means that you can setup scenarios and see if you can hack your way in, but don't run the tools and technique against other people and their devices.

The *objective* of this lesson is to put everything together and hack into our Postgres database in a real-world scenario where:
- Alice's machine with IP `172.16.10.10` is the client and uses `psql -U postgres -h 172.16.10.20` to connect to
- Bob's machine with IP `172.16.10.20` where the PostgreSQL DBMS (i.e. the server) is running

**NOTE** In the following, the images shows different IP addresses than the ones in the text and, also, messages where the *from* and *to* fields have the same IP address while in the text two different IPs are used. I hope this doesn't make the meaning of the text unclear, I'll improve the images ASAP.

### Setup (Step 0)

#### Bridge vs NAT
Since we are using a VM, remember to set the network adapter to bridge. Why? By default, the network adapter of our VM is set to [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) which basically creates a local network in your VM with a set of IP addresses that is different from the one of the local network to which your real computer is connected. In other words, if we're Alice, using `ifconfig` in you VM you'll see an IP address e.g., `10.1.7.10` and on your real machine you'll see `172.16.10.10`. Unless you configure it properly, Bob won't be able to connect to 10.1.7.10 since he's on a *different* network. 

From VirtualBox:
1. right-click your VM from the list of VMs, 
2. Settings -> Network
3. Change "Attached to" from NAT to "Bridged Adapter"

#### Ping
Check the IP addresses of both Alice and Bob and [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) Alice from Bob's machine and vice versa (to be sure they "see each other"). From Alice's machine run `ping 172.16.10.20` and from Bob's machine run `ping 172.16.10.10`.
If things are working properly you should see something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161269113-e07d325d-d232-4af5-9334-f07aab7bbfe0.png)

If things are NOT working:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161268972-7aa4bc59-b396-47a5-8b29-23507831aa5e.png)

#### PostgreSQL configuration
1. `sudo vim /etc/postgresql/12/main/postgresql.conf` (you can always use `nano` instead of `vim`) and:
   1. `ssl = off` -- we'll re-enable in the next lesson
   2. `listen_address ='*'` -- remember to remove the `#` at the beginning of the file to de-comment it.
3. `sudo vim /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf`
   1. enable connections from every IP address (`host  all  all  0.0.0.0/0  md5`). Here the [0.0.0.0/0 means "every IP address"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_route). You should get a pg_hba.conf file as the following.

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161271705-be870496-744d-4ead-8e14-7efcde7fdcd7.png)

### [Where is Everybody?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) (Step 1)
Ok, this is our first real step. We now become Eve, another machine on the same local network (IP `172.16.10.66`), and we want to hack into Bob's db but how do we know the IP of Bob or Alice?

#### Alice (Step 1.1)
Bob is easy to spot! He has PostgreSQL as a service running on his machine and this is advertised to anyone.
You can use `nmap` to scan all the hosts on your local network. So, as Eve we can run `nmap 172.16.10.*`.
Under Bob's IP you'll see something like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161273874-5f1c2d68-fd1d-46e5-b987-66e65b8a10f9.png)

that tells you that he's running the DBMS on the 5432 [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)).

#### Bob (Step 1.2)
Alice is not that easy since she's not running a server but a client and if we scan the network we may not be able to find her.
So we must be patient and set our network card in [promiscuous mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode) and check the traffic
until we see a PGSQL request. You can use `ip link set [net_card] promisc on` where you use your network card name instead of `[net_card]` (use `ifconfig` to find out the network card name -- you may have multiple cards so use the one with the correct IP address).

By filtering on the PGSQL protocol in wireshark, when Alice's connects, you'll see something like this

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161275002-56bf7507-4831-4aa2-a33e-86174ac3d0e9.png)

#### Sniffing and MITM (Step 1.3)
Now that we got their IP, just to have fun, we can run a Man-in-the-Middle Attack. We actually, already have the message exchange of the PGSQL protocol (which we'll inspect in a while) but we also want to have a more "permanent" position in-between Alice and Bob. We want that all the traffic between them pass through us, through our network card.

We can exploit a weakness of the [ARP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) that is a protocol that is used to associate MAC and IP addresses. A MAC address is the identifier of the network card, while the IP address is the identifier of a computer in a network. Due to technical reasons, if you convince Alice that Bob's IP address is associated to your MAC address (and Bob that Alice's IP is associated to your MAC), all the messages exchanged between Alice and Bob will actually be sent to you (and you will forward them). So, you'll be a (Wo)Man-in-the-Middle. The technique we use to perform such attack is [ARP Poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing).

1. `sudo apt install ettercap` (I know... we should use [bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/installation/), which is better)
2. `sudo ettercap -G`
3. select the interface and click on the `V` (accept) at the top of the ettercap window
4. ettercap menu -> hosts -> scan for hosts
5. ettercap menu -> hosts -> host list and search for the IP addresses of Alice and Bob which you can add as Target 1 and Target 2 respectively
6. ettercap menu -> target -> show targets to confirm that Alice and Bob are our target
7. mitm menu -> ARP Poisoning (and wait... it takes a while to convince Alice and Bob that we are Bob for Alice and Alice for Bob)
8. if you go to ettercap menu -> Plugins -> manage plugins you have a lot of fun plugins to load like `isolate` or `remote_browser` but don't be lamer.

Now we can finally use `wireshark` and filter on the IPs (in filters `ip.addr == 172.16.10.10`) and see all the traffic. But since we are interested in PGSQL, we can leave `pgsql` in the filter form of wireshark.

### Read the PGSQL exchange (Step 2)
A fun overview on how PostgreSQL authenticates clients is given [here](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/password-authentication-methods-in-postgresql/) but we focus on md5. 

The firs interesting message is the one selected in:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161280724-73166a48-d6da-4adc-9a21-bb2394fdfea6.png)

where we get to know the user and db names (among other things). Why? Because the credentials (using md5) exchanged are computed as md5(md5(password + postgres_user) + salt) where the salt is a *random string* that prevents the [rainbow table attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). So, if we know the user and the salt, we can use `hashcat` to get the password.

In this message you see the salt:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161281043-42a1ac37-be39-4aff-b00c-adc3eeb6725c.png)

And in here the hash, which is not the hash of the password but the hash calculated as md5(md5(password + postgres_user) + salt) where md5 is our hash function.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161281845-a5918171-0aeb-4700-a497-aa5f11dc7984.png)

### Brute-force the HASH (Step 3)
Hashcat has a specific mode to crack the md5 we just captured (mode 11100) and hashcat expects a file with the hash to crack. If you go [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes#specific_hash_types) you see the format of the file that hashcat wants and:
1. remove md5 from the hash captured
2. $user$user*salt*hash such as: `$postgres$postgres*9f47b50c*2e4c0b97c5740978d3a08a896a3e7703` in my case.
3. `echo "$postgres$postgres*9f47b50c*2e4c0b97c5740978d3a08a896a3e7703" > psql.hash` to save the string into the `psql.hash` file.
4. `hashcat -a 3 -m 11100 ./psql.hash ?a?a?a?a`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161283423-33d4573e-c460-4b1e-a0d7-929b06cef5f9.png)

DONE!!! We got the password and we can connect to Bob with 
`psql -U postgres -h 172.16.10.20` 

### Take-home Message
1. USE SSL! SSL encrypts the communication and so you can't easily extract the hash
2. This is just a test and many many other hacks can be performed. Some we don't know yet ([zero-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing))).
4. Reduce the permissions of the client user to the minimum. You should not allow your clients to connect as superuser because if they are cracked, you give the cracker full access. If the client user postgres is cracked and
   1. has read-only access, he can only break confidentiality
   2. has write access, he can also break integrity
   3. can create/drop table... well, the availability of the whole db is at risk

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/161285209-eb5b32c9-ce69-46cd-ba77-65680253fcaa.png)

### ROLES and PERMISSIONS
It is a good practice to follow the [Principle of leas privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
and to create a ROLE (a user) which is not as powerful as the superuser. For example, a client may
not be allowed to create a new database or drop databases, similar for tables etc., an example follows.
Connect to postgres with `psql -U postgres` and run the following.
```
CREATE USER nonSuperUser WITH NOCREATEROLE NOINHERIT NOBYPASSRLS PASSWORD 'strongPassword' VALID UNTIL '2023-01-31';
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public FROM public;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public FROM nonSuperUser;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO nonSuperUser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO nonSuperUser;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO nonSuperUser;
```

## Lesson 5 - Summary and Reviews and Experiments

### Summary
1. A system is secure if the properties of the *CIA-triad* hold.
2. *Authentication* is another security property (we'll see later on how to use encryption instead of checksums to better understand why authentication is a sub-property of integrity).
3. What a *client-server architecture*, such as the one with `psql` as a client for a PostgreSQL RDBMS server, is.
4. How *hash* are used to generate random tokens (strings such as md52e2af93edc9ab3aea6bbf13b7c409000) from passwords. 
5. Hash of passwords can be *sniffed* form the network if `ssl=off`, with `ssl=on` we can't (more on this in the next lessons)
6. *Weak* passwords can be *brute-forced* with `hashcat` from sniffed md5 hash, breaking the authenticity of the client (from the server perspective). 
7. This password can be later use to break the confidentiality of the *data at-rest* in the db and, if the *role* of the client allows, also their integrity or availability.
8. A local network using ARP is insecure against a *MITM attack* which may allow an attacker to break confidentiality, integrity, and availability of *data in-transit*.
9. Some technicalities, such as:
   1. MD5 is broken, use `scram-sha-256` even if they are both insecure against *brute-force*.
   2. Passwords must be chosen from a rich alphabet and not susceptible to *dictionary attacks*.
   3. The *principle of least privilege*

### Review 1: Network Stack, ARP protocol and MITM Attack
We looked at some network traces with `wireshark` focusing on PGSQL but what are the other sections of the packets?
If you are already familiar with the [ISO OSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) or [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_model) models you can skip this section. Please note that for the sake of simplicity I'll use a mix of the 2 standard models (for those who knows the models: I'm using TCP/IP model except for the link layer where I use the ISO OSI model distinguishing between PHY and MAC layer).
Otherwise, please be aware that I'll just give the intuition, without many details which I believe are not useful for this introduction to cybersecurity.

#### Application Layer
Suppose that `alice` wants to say `ciao` to `bob`.
In the beginning, `alice` creates `ciao` and a new message `ciao` is born in the application layer. 
The application layer is an abstract concept that represents the protocols used by the applications (software) in our computer. 
For example, our browser uses HTTP(S) at application layer or we have used PGSQL at application layer.

#### Layer 1 - Physical Layer
The first problem is that we have `ciao` in our mind and we can even write it down on a
piece of paper or in a file in a computer, but we must somehow transform `ciao`
from a [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal) message in our
computer into an [analog signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal)
so that we can transfer it to `bob`. In other words, if we have a fiber cable 
from `alice` to `bob`, `alice` must first transform `ciao` into light signals, or
if we have an Ethernet cable it works as in the following (incredibly elegant) image.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/162470739-737424c4-406c-4292-80a4-22d728d4e9b3.png)

This is what is done by the protocols at **physical layer**: there are a set of software/hardware that translates a message into an analog signal, based on the type of port used (e.g. Ethernet/RJ45, USB, WiFi, ...).

[This serie of
videos](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory/moderninfotheory/v/symbol-rate-information-theory)
is great if you want to know more on this layer. 

#### Layer 2 - MAC Layer
So far so good but, what if we want to communicate with more than just one Bob?
Instead of connecting Alice's cable directly to `bob` we connect both `alice` and `bob` to a [layer 2 switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_switch#Layer-2_switching) which is an hardware component that keeps track of the association between 
an identifier of the hardware network interface (ethernet in our case). To do so, the switch "writes" in a table 
the relation between its ports and the MAC addresses (which are the identifiers of the physical interface of Alice and Bob)
that are sending messages to that port. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/162470802-c825458f-fafc-47ad-80e4-0c1b191930e2.png)

This is what is done by the protocols at **mac layer**: the address of the network interface of both sender and receiver are
concatenated to the application data so that the *physical layer* can encode the whole message to the switch. The switch will
look at its table to route the message to the recipient by looking at 
1. the mac address of the recipient in the messages it receive from a sender, and
2. looking at the table MAC-PORT

#### Layer 3 - IP Layer
We can't have a cable from a PC to one switch port per each connection. What if we want to connect multiple
PC to a single switch port? Of course we can't add an ultra complex structure of switch layer 2! 
As we introduced an address for the hardware interface, we introduce an address to identify the PC in a network and we call
this IP address.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/162470861-4222fde2-d7ae-48e8-a805-63b2cc0c6208.png)

#### Layer 4 - TCP Layer
It may be that I have multiple services running on my PC, let's use a number (e.g. 5432 for postgres) 
to identify each service. Here we introduce the concept of TCP port which are NOT physical port but virtual 
port associated to each one of our services. So that we can send a message for a specific service by adding the TCP port of the service (5432 for postgres).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14936492/162470918-8e4e1c36-69ab-487f-b620-18e894e8d1f2.png)

#### ARP and MITM
The ARP protocol works at layer 2 and the switch layer 2 only works at layer 1 and 2. The swithc layer 2 doesn't even look at information above layer 2 and then it doesn't look at the IP addresses or TCP ports etc. When we perform a MITM attack (as shown in the previous lesson) we convince, for example, Alice that the MAC of Bob is our MAC (note that your PC has a table similar to that depicted for the switch -- run the following command to see yours `arp`). The switch looks at the MAC to forward the messages so we'll receive all the messages that Alice wants to send to Bob if the MITM is successful.

### Experiment 1: Replay Attack

In a replay attack, an attacker re-uses a message from one session of the protocol in another session. For eaxmple, we may open a connection between psql (client) and postgresql (server), capture the PGSQL message exchange with wireshark.
By looking at the PGSQL authentication protocol (using `ssl = off` and `md5`) using wireshark we can confirm that the protocol works like this:
```
1. Client -> Server: username
2. Server -> Client: salt
3. Client -> Server: md5(md5(username.password).salt)
```
So, can we open _another_ session of the PGSLQ protocol and re-send the message with the credentials (e.g., with [Bit-Twist](http://bittwist.sourceforge.net/)), captured with wireshark (message 3. above)?
We can but we **won't** bypass the authentication process since the server
A. takes the stored `md5(username.password)` and the `salt`
B. calculate the md5 hash `md5(md5(username.password))` and compares with the one received by the client. 

Since we are re-using a message from a previous execution of the protocol, the salt will be different and the server will reject our authentication message.

### Review 2: Hash and Confidentiality
On the other hand, if the PGSQL protocol would not use salts, it would indeed be vulnerable to replay attacks even if the password is never sent as plaintext but always hash-ed. So, what is md5 protecting? and what is protecting it from?

Sending an hash of a password for authenticating a client, if sent as plaintext, is not so much different from sending the password itself al plaintext. Without a salt, PGSQL is just calling the hash of the password, the authenticating credentials. What the hash protects here, is the confidentiality of the password from the server [note], but why? Suppose you are using the same password on 2 different services `ser1` and `ser2`. If `ser1` is owned by a malicious attacker, the attacker won't be able to re-use your hash of the password to authenticate on `ser2` as if he were you.

[note] that it may even protect the confidentiality of the password form the client but since we type our password in plaintext in the client through the keyboard, the client knows our password. If we type an hash of a password, the problem becomes circular and what was the case fo client and server is now the same with the user and the client.

### Exercise: SCRAM-SHA-256
1. change md5 to scram-sha-256 in both the `postgres.conf` and `pg_hba`
2. restart the server
3. capture the PGSQL message exchange and compare them with `md5`.

Test replay attacks and brute-force attack on credentials.
Note that in `/var/logs/postgresql` you can find the log of the postgresql server (with errors in case the configuration/server is not working).
