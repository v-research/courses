### Thesis Proposals

In the following we list three thesis which should be interpreted more as areas
where the student will start her journey, rather than a "point" that the
student should follow. In other words, we expect you to build and propose your
own views on the subjects, to critically analyze your steps and... ours too.
If you don't know exactly what we mean, opt for "I'm a believer".

1. *I'm a believer* -- A quantitative but non-inductive approach to cyber-security risk assessment \[[read more](./thesis/thesis-1.md)\]
2. *I'm an engineer* -- A formal approach to the engineering of security protocols and cyber-physical systems \[[read more](./thesis/thesis-2.md)\]
3. *Pff... I'm a scientist, give me a challenge!* -- An attacker model beyond the Dolev-Yao one \[[read more](./thesis/thesis-3.md)\]

### Internship Proposal

Internships are focused on creating something. But this something will be a way for us to interact.
The project will be open-source so that you can share it with the world, proudly showing what you're capable of!
We'll guide you through the engineering process, we'll teach you how to properly design and test your system. 
We expect you to be able to implement a desing, but if you aren't able to properly write code you can still choose "wanna believe".
As part of the internship, you'll also have the opportunity to join our research activities and meetings.

1. *wanna believe* -- Conclude the "game" [the-practical-men](https://thepracticalmen.v-research.it) (artistic or engineering challenge)
2. *wanna engineer* -- Design, Implementation, and Testing of [mr.hide](./internship/mrhide.md)
3. *wanna read* -- Design, Implementation, and Testing of [Athena's Library](./internship/athenslib.md)
3. *wanna socialize* -- Design, Implementation, and Testing of [HideJack](./internship/hidejack.md)
