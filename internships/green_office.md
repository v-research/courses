## System description 

**green_office** is an office-size, automatic irrigation system which helps us keeping our plants happy & healthy.

More specifically, the system
1. acquires data from the sensors (e.g. humidity) to check the health status of the plants,
2. controls (the actuators of) the irrigation system, 
4. allows the user to remotely (and super-securely) control the status of the system, and plants.

Please, remember that plants are living things and friend of us.
