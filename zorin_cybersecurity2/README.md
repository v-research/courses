# Cybersecurity 2
This is a [git repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) which is hosted on GitHub; a beautiful place where we learn together cybersecurity and what faith will bring us. In this README I write my notes of the course but much of the content is, for brevity, a link to external resources. If you have any suggestion to improve this text or the course, please open an [issue](https://github.com/v-research/pascal/issues/new/choose).

## Lesson 1 - Intro

### Requisite (because it is a logical AND between all the following) to attend this course:
1. Use the *pen-and-paper* approach to take notes during each lecture! This is the most important part of the whole course. If you don't take notes, it is likely that you won't remember what we have done. Mis-understanding will pile up in time and we won't be speaking the same language very very soon (as you won't understand what I'm saying).
2. *Study*! If you don't invest time in reading and **reason** on your notes (something like: "wait! I wrote integrity but what was the definition? let's look on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security)) you can spare the effort of keeping notes in the first place. You *have to* spend your time in reasoning on your notes or you won't understand what we are doing. At the beginning it may seem you can remember the whole blablabla of each lesson, but it is going to become ultra-complex in a bit. The difference between listening and understanding determines the distance that you have to walk in this course: 
   1. listen, 
   2. draft notes, 
   3. review note with a critical mind (wikipedia, duckduckgo, google and **marco@v-research.it** are your best [friends](https://www.amazon.it/Lamicizia-latino-fronte-Tullio-Cicerone/dp/8817067008/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DVEA9A01CN98&keywords=cicerone+amicizia&qid=1646997948&sprefix=cicerone+amicizia%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-1)... Cicero too), 
   4. believe you have understood something, 
   5. test your believed understanding until you find a counter-example (how? talk to your [best friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), and 
   6. be vigilant forever after.
4. Create a [study group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_group) and study together because "When students study in groups, they can motivate and encourage each other and lessen procrastination". Consider investing time (e.g., a couple of hours) after each lesson to review together the notes. Tell each other (even if it seems trivial) what we've done during the last lesson(s) and if it is all clear then:
5. *Relax*. Take your time, stay away from your notes. Let them ripe.

>We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.
>John Keating, "Dead Poets Society"
