## Learning Outcomes
In this course, the students will be divided into teams with the objective 
of **understanding**, **designing**, and **implementing** a login system which do
not require the user to remember the password. 
Each team has 3 members, each one with a specific role.

* *Scientist* - A set of high-level functional requirements will be given to the students and the scientist has the objective to refine them by understanding the role of passwords in login systems and how to (if possible) improve the usual username-and-password approach that requires the user to remember the credentials.

* *Engineer* - in this role, the student will design the login system, interacting with the scientist to understand how to satisfy the requirements. His main concerns are not on how to invent a new login system but how to structure/design a login system so that the scientists' idea are considered and a programmer can effectively implement them. He will work on use cases and UML diagrams (deployment, activity and class diagram).

* *Programmer*, the one who translates the design into practice. He is focused on technologies and he setup the development environment choosing programming languages and technologies to easily and quickly implement the engineer's design.

Each class will be a continuous workshop where each group works on its project.
Collaborations between groups will be facilitated by the teachers, and each
lesson will have 3 brainstorming sessions: one with the scientists, one with
the engineers, and one with the programmers.

From the RFC 1392, an **hacker** is
>a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
>internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
>particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
>where "cracker" would be the correct term.
