## Learning Outcomes
In this course the students will be divided in groups and they will develop a cybersecure login following an engineering process.
Then they will try to attack other group's login system and they will understand the weaknesses.  
Shortly: **the students become hackers!**

From the RFC 1392, an **hacker** is
>a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
>internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
>particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
>where "cracker" would be the correct term.

## There are 3 roles in your teams:
* *Scientist*, the real science expert. His strong point is the theory, he really loves to study and his job is to detail the problem statement, to define the requirements and justify them.
* *Engineer*, he knows how to make it work. He makes an use case analysis, then a deployment, activity and class diagram and finally he describes the implementation.
* *Programmer*, the one who translates the design into practice. First of all, he has to setup a development environment which easily allows his team to collaborate in an efficient way, so he codes together with his team.
