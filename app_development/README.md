# Welcome to the Club of the Practical Men,
[those who live their lives and then think about it](https://www.knowledgezero.com/finding-cybersecure)

## The Practical Men
In this game, you are an hacker who want to engineer a cybersecure system.

From the RFC 1392, an **hacker** is 
>a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
>internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
>particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
>where "cracker" would be the correct term.

## The Im-practical Society
In the world there are 3 types of people: 
* (Un)Practical men, like you
* Captains, who created this game and will help you and defend you from
* Pirates, who will attack your solutions

## There are 3 types of Practical Men:
* *Scientist*, the real science expert. His strong point is the theory, he really loves to study and his job is to detail the problem statement, to define the requirements and justify them.
* *Engineer*, 

## Practical Live Meetings
* (in Italian) every Thursday 20.30-22.30 we are live - buy one lesson [here](https://www.thepracticalmen.com)
* (in English) every Wednesday 20.30-22.30 - buy one lesson [here](https://www.thepracticalmen.com)

# The Practical Game
There's an EXPLANATION(.md) of the game but you *should* really go on and read
the explanation only if you truly want to quit playing this game.

As practical men, we play practical games. So, in this game we build and
demolish.  The repo structure is simple so you'll easily find what you need to
build (just browse it or... [hint](./methodology-activity-UML.png)).  The real objective is to learn cybersecurity with an
hacker mindset and to close the open challenges (look at the issues of this
repo on github).

We play this game because an hacker mindset cannot be taught but only cultivated:
1. insecurities (or hacks) of a technology can be found once you deeply understand the technology.
2. building or destroying (as proposed in CTF) any system won't make you deeply understand it.
3. but a critical mindset and the will to understand may do.
3. what if I don't have such "love" with me?
4. either find a challenge you love, propose one, or simply give up.

## A Pointless Game
If you search for easy rewards, this is not your game.  If you hope that your
skills will be weighted as a cucumber (in a scoreboard), you better search for
a fruit seller.  We only want you to implement or design, and to test or
verify, improving your engineering ability. We'll hack your system, you'll get
stronger, and... maybe... you'll fight back!  Your sole final goal and great
achievement is developing an hacker mindset.  If you don't spent your time in
digging deeper into your own ignorance, you have not learned! No matter how
hard you hide it from you, you know you are not an hacker.  

**Think EASY**, choose an easy challenge! When you have a solution (even
partial) you can open a pull request from your branch to the tpm branch. From
there, we'll play together :) The comments of your captain in the pull requests
chat will be our qualitative evaluation of your solutions, our kind and humble
opinion on what you've done and what we hope for your next steps. Our
acceptance of your solution to the tpm branch, will be the only score you get.
But it will still be our educated, pointless opinion on what you've created. 

## Actions
The final objective is to have a cybersecure system.
Towards this end, you can:

0. *ask* questions (during our live sessions, on the Teams channel, or via github)
1. *write* new requirements 
2. *refine* requirements
3. *design* an implementation
4. *verify* design/requirements
5. *implement* design/requirements 
6. *test* an implementation

For example, if you implement a script to exchange information:
* how do you know if it adheres to the confidentiality requirement?
* and how do you know if it doesn't?
The only way is to test your own script. Try to capture the non-confidential exchange!

## A Non Not-Cooperative Game
You can cooperate, you may not cooperate. This is a non not-cooperative game.
So, you can cooperate with other practical men as long as
you want to. But you can also betray them by proposing a pull request 
that, if accepted, will force them (or everyone?) to adapt to your changes.
Maybe they'll change approach and leave you alone to finish what 
you started together... and you'll be a pirate!

## Rules
0. anyone can ask questions 
1. questions are free of any cost
2. an answer from a captain may come at the cost of completing a task

## System Description
The [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard))
of the system is given by the requirements collected in the requirements
directory.
