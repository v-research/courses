# Welcome to the Explanation for the Practical Men,
[those who do not have taste](https://www.knowledgezero.com)

1. We impose an initial structure (the directories of this very repo) but we allow 
you to discover it, instead of telling you what it is.
2. Start from the open issues on github (they have very visible flag... I mean, name).
3. Read the README (rtfm, with love :\*)
4. If you want, we can guide you through the game by following the rules in the README. 
5. Aren't you bothered by this? Go play kid! Ok, you want to know more?
We can answer even this question, but our answers have a price.  What price
can we ask for? We can (only) steal your understanding; we are taking it for
you.
6. Now that the cost is clear, we can question your questions
during our live meeting (link in the README). Why? questions
are free of charge in the club. Answers aren't intrinsically
free, they demand an effort (not simply money).
7. [hint] you can add derived\_requirements.
We give no explanation of what derived requirements are. Hopefully 
you'll find out
9. Ok, you haven't, right? There you can place the requirements
which are necessary to re-create your solution. If, for example,
you have a script that uses netcat (nc) to implement
the requirement-engineering, you better write it somewhere.
You can write the design in UML and add it to the designs 
dir or simply write some requirements to be sure 
that it's clear what your system is.
11. Read carefully the authentication requirement of the artistic challenge.
12. Why did we write the requirement the way we wrote it? Because 
the meaning of a picture can be transferred by transferring the
picture over a channel (as in engineering) or by letting 
the picture convey a message only to those who correctly
"read the light" coming from it. 
17. During our live sessions,
we guide your questions. What is this game? An hard way of
reasoning together towards a cybersecure system. So
that we all get an intimate understanding of systems.
Whatever system you choose. 
18. You have already lost so much "learning" that we are not sure
if you have something more to offer :) yet!
